                <span id="descriptors"><strong>On Programming</strong></span>
                <p id="title"><strong>I have doubts about whether programming is actually an attractive career path anymore. <br>
                Why do I say this?
                <br><br>
                The fear of AI, mostly. AI tools like Cursor, and Windsurf are proving imposing and can generally do what a programmer does. <br>
                The force of the rise of AI in just a short span of time has magnified this fear. I believe that human programmers still have a place in Computer Science,
                obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be coding. This place, however, speaking as a non-expert in the matter, is that of learning what AI does and how it does what it does.
                I'm excited to keep learning still, about what computers can do to make the world a better place. The most exciting part is what I could possibly contribute to this development.

                <span id="descriptors"><strong>On Film</strong></span>
                <p id="title"><strong>Is the film camera representing the viewer's POV or is it a suggestion for a viewing mental model?<br>
                Why do I ask this?
                <br><br>
                Watching film is only possible because of filming. This is then broadcast to us, the viewers. One picture at a time. From multiple perspectives.<br>
                That one fact alone is probably a giveaway, but I wasn't aware that the camera wasn't meant to be in stead of my view. I guess it is meant to be a "state of mind",
                whose 'state of mind' ? It seems absurd to me that I should occupy these many positions as a film camera suggests. One instance I'm closer, the next? seeing from the side.
                Film is exciting for it though, I believe. But I also believe this is when Theatre gets its edge and suggestion.
